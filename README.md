# LoRaFence - Advanced Wildlife Tracking System

Welcome to **LoRaFence**, Developed by the **United Technical College**, LoRaFence harnesses advanced LoRa technology for precise and efficient animal tracking and virtual fencing. With cutting-edge enhancements like embedded displays, collars for animals, and multi-tracker systems, LoRaFence is poised to redefine animal tracking in conservation and research. This project is a proud participant in the Semi;Colon Hackathon, and with your support, we're aiming for the win!

## Advantages Over Traditional Technologies

| **Criteria**           | **LoRaFence**                  | **Satellite**              | **Cellular**                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Cost-Effectiveness** | Low operational cost           | High subscription costs    | SIM cards and data fees      |
| **Power Efficiency**   | Extremely low power            | High power consumption     | Medium power usage           |
| **Range & Coverage**   | Up to 50 KM in rural areas     | Global coverage, high cost | Limited to network areas     |
| **Scalability**        | Supports dense IoT networks    | Expensive to scale         | Limited by cost              |
| **Data Throughput**    | Ideal for IoT sensors          | Excessive for IoT          | High but inefficient for IoT |
| **Ease of Deployment** | Private networks, simple setup | Complex and costly         | Dependent on infrastructure  |
| **Privacy & Security** | Full control with private nets | Data via third parties     | Data vulnerable to leaks     |

## Deployment Use Cases

1. **Wildlife Conservation**: Track endangered species and study migration patterns without disturbing their habitat.
2. **Animal Control**: Use virtual fencing with sound and haptic feedback to guide animals or cattle within a specific area.

---

## How It Works

1. **Animal Collars** with embedded LoRa modules transmit GPS data and stimuli feedback.
2. **Raspberry Pi Display Modules** receive and display the location data in ranger vehicles.
3. Data is uploaded to the **cloud** for centralized monitoring and management.
4. Animals are controlled within a geofence using a two-threshold system:
   - **First Zone**: Audible sounds to recall animals.
   - **Second Zone**: Haptic feedback for stronger stimuli.
